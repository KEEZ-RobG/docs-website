# About

LUKSO is a blockchain of standards for onboarding the non-technical everyday person. Through innovative smart contract standards and an unprecedented user experience, it will remove the entry barrier of complication and risk associated with managing crypto assets. As a result of this new opportunity, a rich and diverse community, excited to take advantage of the possibilities enabled by decentralization and digital ownership, has emerged.

The LUKSO blockchain offers a rare opportunity: participation in the launch of a highly decentralized blockchain, a sister to Ethereum 2.0 nonetheless!
To participate in a true proof-of-stake blockchain, you must run a  node and validator software on your own hardware or a cloud platform. Other options (such as staking pools) will exist in the future, but those require giving up custody of your keys to a third-party service and will not benefit from the high rewards of the initial launch period.




## Objective

A more diverse community means a more diverse set of technical abilities, which creates a disproportionate opportunity within the community, as running a validator is not yet a user-friendly experience.

The information and guides on the KEEZ validator website are specifically written for less technical people. Our mission is to increase equality by supporting everyone willing to commit to the responsibility.


## Validator Responsibility

The process of setting up a validator node can be intimidating. You must interact with software through a command line, follow best security practices diligently, and commit to long-term maintenance. Maintaining a validator node is a significant responsibility. Your investment will be substantial, but, most importantly, **the network's security and stability depend on validators running proper equipment and staying active.** This will always be the first priority for those who author and maintain this site.

## Community Support Roadmap
#### Organized documentation
Organize community authored documentation and official documentation in a step-by-step workflow.
#### Video examples of text
Screen captured video of steps being completed
#### KEEZ Help Desk
A help desk for validator support on the KEEZ Discord with a ticket managment system and scheduled one-on-one support sessions.
#### Community Participation Token
A non-transferable toked automatically issued for commits that are merged to the KEEZ docs repo and participation in tech support. Can be displayed as a badge on your UP, used for reputation purposes, and may have speculative non-monitary value in the future KEEZ initiatives.
#### NFT for Genesis validators
A community created NFT that will be issued to genesis validators who opt-in by indicating their UP address as grafiti. The NFT will be automatiicaly issued for the first ?? blocks.

## Background

LUKSO is a blockchain of standards for onboarding the non-technical everyday person. Through innovative smart contract standards and an unprecedented user experience, it will remove the entry barrier of complication and risk associated with managing crypto assets. As a result of this new opportunity, a rich and diverse community, excited to take advantage of the possibilities enabled by decentralization and digital ownership, has emerged.

The LUKSO blockchain offers a rare opportunity: participation in the launch of a highly decentralized blockchain, a sister to Ethereum 2.0 nonetheless!
To participate in a true proof-of-stake blockchain, you must run a node and validator software on your own hardware or a cloud platform. Other options (such as staking pools) will exist in the future, but those require giving up custody of your keys to a third-party service and will not benefit from the high rewards of the initial launch period.

## Mission
Education and guidance for a community with a wide range of technical skills, with focus on assisting non-power users.

## Objective

A step-by-step guide to navigate the official LUKSO documentation and community authored documentation needed to setup, monitor, and maintain a LUKSO node and (optional) validator.

Technical support for non-network issues, such as system configuration, remote access, and monitoring software.

Fun stuff

## Validator Responsibility

The process of setting up a validator node can be intimidating. You must interact with software through a command line, follow best security practices diligently, and commit to long-term maintenance. Maintaining a validator node is a significant responsibility. Your investment will be substantial, but, most importantly, **the network's security and stability depend on validators running proper maintaiing their nodes and keeping them online.** Our first priority is to the network. If you can not make that commitment DO NOT run a node.

## Community Support Roadmap
#### Organized documentation
Organize community authored documentation and official documentation in a step-by-step workflow.
#### Video examples of text
Screen captured video of steps being completed
#### KEEZ Help Desk
A help desk for validator support on the KEEZ Discord with a ticket managment system and scheduled one-on-one support sessions.
#### Community Participation Token
A non-transferable toked automatically issued for commits that are merged to the KEEZ docs repo and participation in tech support. Can be displayed as a badge on your UP, used for reputation purposes, and may have speculative non-monitary value in the future KEEZ initiatives.
#### NFT for Genesis validators
A community created NFT that will be issued to genesis validators who opt-in by indicating their UP address as grafiti. The NFT will be automatiicaly issued for the first ?? blocks.
